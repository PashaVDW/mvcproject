<?php

// The Response class handles the generation and sending of the HTTP response back to the client.
// It provides methods to set response headers,
// set the response body content, and send the response to the client's browser.
// The Response class abstracts away the details of the HTTP protocol,
// making it easier to construct and send responses.
// Typically, the Response class allows you to set the response status code (e.g., 200 for OK, 404 for Not Found),
// set response headers (e.g., content type), and write the response body (e.g., HTML content) to be sent back to the client.
